        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 16, 2026</p>

        <p>RhemaFlow ("we", "our", "the app") is a faith-based declaration app that helps you speak Scripture-based affirmations over your life. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your name, email address, and profile photo from your provider.</li>
            <li>If you use the app as a guest, no personal information is collected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>User-Generated Content</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Declarations you create and save, including the text, Bible verse references, selected category, and atmosphere preference.</li>
            <li>AI-generated images associated with your saved declarations (Pro subscribers only).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>App Preferences</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notification settings (enabled/disabled, preferred time).</li>
            <li>Default atmosphere and category selections.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Usage Data</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We track the number of declarations you generate each day to manage free-tier usage limits. This count resets daily and is linked to your user ID.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Device Identifiers</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We collect your device's Android ID or iOS Identifier for Vendor to prevent abuse of free-tier limits across multiple accounts on the same device. This identifier is used solely for usage enforcement and is not used for advertising or cross-app tracking.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Subscription Data</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you subscribe to RhemaFlow Pro, your purchase is processed by Google Play or the Apple App Store. We use RevenueCat to verify your subscription status. We do not collect or store your payment card details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To provide the app experience</strong> — generating personalized faith declarations, text-to-speech audio (Pro), and background images (Pro) using Google Gemini AI.</li>
            <li><strong>To save your content</strong> — storing your declarations and favorites so they persist across sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>To manage your subscription</strong> — verifying your subscription status and enforcing daily usage limits for free-tier users.</li>
            <li><strong>To prevent abuse</strong> — using device identifiers and daily counters to ensure fair usage of free-tier resources.</li>
            <li><strong>To send reminders</strong> — delivering local daily notifications at your chosen time if enabled.</li>
            <li><strong>To authenticate your account</strong> — verifying your identity so your data is private and accessible only to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> — authentication, database storage, file storage, and cloud functions. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> — generates declaration text, speech audio, and images based on your selected category and mood. Your category and mood selections are sent to this service for processing but are not stored by us beyond the generated output.</li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — manages subscription status and entitlements. Your user ID and purchase receipts are shared with RevenueCat to verify your subscription. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In / Apple Sign-In</strong> — used for authentication only. We do not access your contacts, calendars, or other account data.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play / Apple App Store</strong> — processes subscription payments. We do not have access to your payment details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is stored in Firebase (Google Cloud) with security rules that restrict access to your account only.</li>
            <li>Generated images are stored in Firebase Storage and associated with your user ID.</li>
            <li>Daily usage data is stored server-side and is not retained beyond what is necessary to enforce daily limits.</li>
            <li>We do not store data locally on your device beyond temporary audio cache files that are cleaned up after playback.</li>
            <li>All data is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. Your data is only processed by the third-party services listed above as necessary to provide the app's functionality.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delete individual declarations</strong> — you can delete any saved declaration and its associated image from within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> — you can delete your account and all associated data from the app settings. This permanently removes your profile, declarations, and stored images.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage your subscription</strong> — you can cancel or manage your subscription at any time through Google Play or the App Store.</li>
            <li><strong>Sign out</strong> — you can sign out at any time from the settings screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Data access and portability</strong> — you may request a copy of your personal data by contacting us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>RhemaFlow is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

        <h2>8. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app may request the following device permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet</strong> — required to communicate with Firebase and AI services.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — for optional daily declaration reminders.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio playback</strong> — to play generated speech and background atmosphere music.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
