# RhemaFlow UI Polish Design

**Goal:** Elevate the app's visual quality to a premium/luxury feel with glass effects, gold accents, and subtle depth — without changing functionality.

**Direction:** Keep the dark/fire/spiritual brand, add frosted glass treatments, gold shimmer accents, refined typography, and smoother interactive states.
